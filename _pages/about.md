I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, in the [Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Research Group](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml/people). My main research interet  is **Reinforcement Learning**.

I recently got a PhD in Information Technology from Politecnico di Milano, Italy, with a dissertation on "Safe Policy Optimization", advised by Marcello Restelli. You can find it [here](http://hdl.handle.net/10589/17019http://hdl.handle.net/10589/1701966).
