I'm an **assistant professor at Politecnico di Milano**, Milan, Italy, in the [Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Lab](https://rl.airlab.deib.polimi.it/).

My research focus is **reinforcement learning**.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the AI&ML group of [UPF](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml), in Barcelona.
There, I co-organized [RLSS 2023](https://rlsummerschool.com/), a reinforcement learning summer school (videos of most lectures are available).
