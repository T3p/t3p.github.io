I'm an **assistant professor at Politecnico di Milano**, Milan, Italy, at *Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria*, and an Ellis member of the [Milan unit](https://ellis.eu/units/milan).

My research focus is **reinforcement learning**.

In Politecnico I advise two PhD students and several master students. I'm also a TA for **AI and machine learning classes** and I will teach the Algorithms class in the next semester.

I'm local co-chair of [ALT 2025](http://algorithmiclearningtheory.org/alt2025/).

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the AI&ML group of [UPF](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml) Barcelona, where I co-organized [RLSS 2023](https://rlsummerschool.com/), and a research intern at Facebook AI (now Meta). I obtained my PhD at Politecnico di Milano, with a dissertation on policy gradient algorithms.
