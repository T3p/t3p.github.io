I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml), Barcelona, working with [Gergely Neu](http://cs.bme.hu/~gergo/). My main research interest  is **Reinforcement Learning**.

I recently got a **PhD** in Information Technology from Politecnico di Milano, Italy, with a dissertation on "Safe Policy Optimization", advised by [Marcello Restelli](https://restelli.faculty.polimi.it/MyWebSite/index.shtml). You can find my dissertation [here](http://hdl.handle.net/10589/170196). 

I was a research intern at **Facebook AI** from September to December 2020, working with [Matteo Pirotta](https://teopir.github.io/) and [Alessandro Lazaric](https://dblp.org/pid/36/321.html).
