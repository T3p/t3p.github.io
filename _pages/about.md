I'm an assistant professor at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) in Milan, Italy. 

My research focus is **reinforcement learning**.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the AI&ML group of [UPF](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml), in Barcelona.

There, I co-organized [RLSS 2023](https://rlsummerschool.com/), a reinforcement learning summer school.
